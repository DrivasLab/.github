# Drivas Lab

**Computational and experimental genomics for human disease genetics** at Penn Medicine.

We study the genetic basis of rare diseases—particularly ciliopathies—using large-scale biobank data, functional genomics, and machine learning approaches.

## Research Areas

- Rare disease genetics and variant interpretation
- PheWAS and biobank-scale association studies
- Graph neural networks for genomic data
- Functional genomics of ciliopathies
